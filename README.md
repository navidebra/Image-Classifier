# Image Classifier App using Command Line

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, first a code for an image classifier was built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

### Project Overview

This project aims to use a given image database with chosen parameters using command line to train a neural network and predict accordingly using command line.
